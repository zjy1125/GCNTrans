# GCNTrans
GCNTrans is a novel model that leverages both structural and sequential features of proteins for interaction prediction.
It constructs the adjacency matrix using 3D structural information predicted by AlphaFold, 
while employing protein sequence representations generated by a protein language model as the node feature matrix, 
providing rich semantic information.
By combining the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Transformer architectures, 
GCNTrans effectively captures both structural and sequential features of input data. 
This deep integration enhances the model's generalization ability in predicting PPIs.

# Datasets
We provided datasets for three species, 
including Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays. 
For the prediction of Arabidopsis PPIs, 
four non-redundant datasets filtered by different sequence identity thresholds (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) were constructed.<br>

Dataset/ contains all the datasets required for Arabidopsis PPIs prediction.<br>
cross_species dataset/ contains all the datasets required for rice and maize PPIs prediction.<br>
Feature/ contains the process of constructing the adjacency matrix and obtaining ESM features.<br>
